# SUST-Medical-Center-Server

This is the server application for our 250 project **"SUST Medical Center Automation"**. 
It is to delete the previous day appointments and to add a new day at the end of already available days for the students to make new appointments.
As we couldn't deploy this application to the cloud, we will run it manually everyday.
This application is written entirely in **javascript** and the frameword used is **Node.js**.
